This repository contains the programming examples I made when working through
the book ***Learning Python, 5th Edition*** by Mark Lutz. 

This project is meant to serve as a general programming reference to anyone
learning Python, teaching Python, and/or also working through the book.

For more information about the book, including materials provided by the
author, visit:
